Arrays

- comes with predefined methods: (sort, split, pop, push)
you can pass a function into another function

Two Types of Functions:
higher order function - a function that takes another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value
callback function - a function that is passed into a higher order function as an argument, then used inside it (called back)

more predefined methods: (reduce, filter, map) - higher order functions that takes a callback function as an argument.
iteration methods - they all hae return methods. 

Reduce returns a single value. 
Map and filter returns a new array.
