The website will provide 3-4 courses/tutorials/lessons that a person can choose to take.

2. User Interface Design and Prototype
# Give some sample user interface layouts for your application. You can use either wireframe diagrams or prototyping tools to construct the 
mock representations of your UI design.
I will use Power Point for my mock up.

#Briefly explain the rationale behind designing your UI and how it is geared towards supporting the list of features for your application.
I will be using "cards/ widgets" that holds the information about the class. They click on it to learn more.
