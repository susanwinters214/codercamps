Answer the following:

1. How your project will benefit from React

# What are the main differences between Bootstrap and React?

Bootstrap is a framework that you build your website on. You use the code for the layout, styles, etc. It also has components you can use
for reusable code including a carousel and more.

React is a library. You can use it to build a website or add it to an existing website. React uses components that renders data.

# What will React allow you to do that would have been difficult with Bootstrap?
At this point (week 2) I have no idea.

2. Expected List of React Components

# A brief list of the React Components you will need to develop for your application
- Header / Logo
- Nav Bar
- Footer
- Card / Widget

# Brief justifications for including these components
I think the first 3 are obvious. These will be seen on every page as the web template layout.
The 4th one will be used over and over again. I will have 3-4 of these on my page.


3. Team responsibilities

# Which team member will own the development of which React Component?
I will build my own components.
